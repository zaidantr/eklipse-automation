# Test Case Automation

This is an assessment test from a company called Eklipse. I successfully got an invitation for the first interview but rejected it due to an offer from another company. Eklipse is an AI tool for editing videos for streamers and content creators. I automated some of the features such as login, edit profile, etc., using Cypress.

## Installation

1. Run terminal
2. Input npm install
3. Then npx cypress open
